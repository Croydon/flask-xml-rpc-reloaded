# Flask-XML-RPC-Re (Flask-XML-RPC-Reloaded)

This is a library that lets your Flask apps provide XML-RPC APIs. A small
example is included.


## Install

``pip install flask-xml-rpc-re``


## Compatible to Flask-XML-RPC

Flask-XML-RPC-Reloaded is a fork of the original Flask-XML-RPC, which was unfortunately abandoned.
This version should be 100% compatible and therefore a drop-in replacement for Flask-XML-RPC.


### Differences to Flask-XML-RPC

 * Python 3 support thanks to [@Ppjet6](https://github.com/ppjet6) ([PR](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-xml-rpc/pull-requests/2/added-python3-support-alongside-python2/diff))
 * Uses the new Flask extension naming scheme thanks to [FÃ©lix Bouliane](https://bitbucket.org/felixbouliane/) ([PR](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-xml-rpc/pull-requests/4/use-the-new-flask-naming-scheme/diff))
