    This is the basic XML-RPC handler class. To use it, you create it::
    
        handler = XMLRPCHandler('api')
    
    Then, you can register functions with the :meth:`register` method::
    
        @handler.register
        def spam():
            pass
    
    :meth:`register` is just an alias for :meth:`register_function`, so you
    can use that too.
    You can also register an instance using the :meth:`register_instance`
    method, and any methods on said instance will be exposed if they do not
    start with an ``_``.
    
    Then, you connect it to a :class:`~flask.Flask` instance or a Flask
    module with the :meth:`connect` method, like this::
    
        handler.connect(app, '/')
    
    :param endpoint_name: The name to use as an endpoint when connected to
                          an app or module. If not specified here, you specify
                          when you call :meth:`connect`.
    :param instance: The instance to register and expose the methods of.
    :param introspection: Whether to register the introspection functions,
                          like :obj:`system.listMethods`. (It will by
                          default.)

            handler.register_function(spam)
            handler.register_function(spam, 'spam')
